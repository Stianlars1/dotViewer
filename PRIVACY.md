# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

dotViewer is designed with privacy as a core principle. The app operates entirely on your local device and does not collect, transmit, or store any user data externally.

## Data Collection

**dotViewer does not collect any data.** Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No usage analytics or telemetry
- No file contents are transmitted
- No network requests are made
- No crash reports are sent automatically

## Local Processing

All file previews are processed locally on your Mac:

- Files are read directly from your local filesystem
- Syntax highlighting is performed on-device
- Settings are stored in local UserDefaults (App Group container)
- No data leaves your computer

## Permissions

dotViewer requires the following system permissions:

- **Quick Look Extension** - To provide file previews in Finder
- **App Group Container** - To share settings between the main app and Quick Look extension

These permissions are used solely for the app's core functionality.

## Third-Party Services

dotViewer does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Data Storage

The only data stored by dotViewer is your preferences:

- Selected theme
- Font size
- Line number visibility
- Enabled/disabled file types
- Custom extension mappings
- Preferred editor selection

This data is stored locally in the macOS App Group container and is not accessible by other applications.

## App Store

If you download dotViewer from the Mac App Store, Apple may collect standard App Store analytics (downloads, crashes) according to Apple's privacy policy. dotViewer itself does not have access to this data.

## Changes to This Policy

Any changes to this privacy policy will be reflected in this document with an updated date.
