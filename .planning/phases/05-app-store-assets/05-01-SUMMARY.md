# Plan 05-01 Summary: Create Marketing Screenshots

## Result: COMPLETE

**Duration:** ~15 min (manual screenshot capture)
**Approach:** User captured screenshots directly and uploaded to App Store Connect

## What Was Done

1. **Sample files created** (commit 767155a)
   - `.planning/assets/screenshots/samples/AppViewModel.swift`
   - `.planning/assets/screenshots/samples/.env.example`
   - `.planning/assets/screenshots/samples/README.md`

2. **Screenshots captured by user**
   - 7 screenshots at correct dimensions (2880x1800)
   - Stored at: `/Users/stian/Documents/dev/dotViewer stuff/screenshots app store/`
   - Files: preview_1-3.png, screenshot_1-4.png

3. **Uploaded to App Store Connect**
   - User uploaded screenshots directly to App Store listing
   - No local copy needed in `.planning/assets/screenshots/`

## Deviation from Plan

The plan called for 5 specific screenshots saved locally. User instead:
- Captured 7 screenshots covering the same themes
- Uploaded directly to App Store Connect
- Skipped local storage step (not needed for App Store submission)

This is a valid completion - the goal (marketing screenshots in App Store Connect) was achieved.

## Files Modified

- `.planning/assets/screenshots/samples/` - 3 sample files for screenshots
