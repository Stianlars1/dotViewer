<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create screenshots directory and requirements doc</name>
  <files>.planning/assets/screenshots/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create directory structure at `.planning/assets/screenshots/`.

Create README.md documenting:
1. Mac App Store screenshot requirements:
   - At least 1, max 10 screenshots
   - Supported sizes: 2880x1800, 2560x1600, 1440x900, or 1280x800 pixels
   - Recommended: 2880x1800 (Retina) for crisp display

2. Screenshot suggestions for dotViewer (3-5 recommended):
   - Screenshot 1: QuickLook preview showing Swift code with syntax highlighting (hero shot)
   - Screenshot 2: QuickLook preview showing a .env file with sensitive data warning banner
   - Screenshot 3: Theme selection in the main app settings
   - Screenshot 4: Custom file type registration UI
   - Screenshot 5: (Optional) Side-by-side comparison showing multiple file types

3. Capture instructions:
   - Use Cmd+Shift+4 then Space to capture window
   - Or use Screenshot.app for more control
   - Resize/crop to exact dimensions using Preview or sips command

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Capture App Store marketing screenshots</action>
  <instructions>
I've created the screenshots directory and documented requirements.

**Your action:**

1. Open dotViewer and the QuickLook extension
2. Prepare sample files that showcase syntax highlighting well:
   - A Swift file (e.g., ContentView.swift)
   - A .env file to show the sensitive data warning
   - Different file types to show range of support

3. Capture 3-5 screenshots:
   - Screenshot 1: QuickLook preview of syntax-highlighted code (HERO)
   - Screenshot 2: Sensitive file warning banner
   - Screenshot 3: Theme picker in settings
   - Screenshot 4: Custom file type registration
   - Screenshot 5: (Optional) Another file type

4. Resize each to 2880x1800 pixels (or 1440x900 if easier):
   ```bash
   # Using sips to resize (macOS built-in):
   sips -z 1800 2880 screenshot.png --out resized.png

   # Or to crop to exact size:
   sips -c 1800 2880 screenshot.png --out cropped.png
   ```

5. Save to `.planning/assets/screenshots/`:
   - screenshot-01-hero.png
   - screenshot-02-warning.png
   - screenshot-03-themes.png
   - screenshot-04-custom-types.png
   - screenshot-05-variety.png (optional)

**Requirements:**
- Minimum: 1 screenshot
- Recommended: 3-5 screenshots
- Size: 2880x1800 or 1440x900 pixels

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify screenshots meet requirements</name>
  <files>N/A (verification only)</files>
  <action>
Check each screenshot in .planning/assets/screenshots/:
1. Verify at least 1 PNG file exists
2. Check dimensions are valid App Store sizes (2880x1800, 2560x1600, 1440x900, or 1280x800)
3. Report any that need adjustment

Use sips to check dimensions:
```bash
for f in .planning/assets/screenshots/*.png; do
  sips -g pixelHeight -g pixelWidth "$f"
done
```

If any screenshots don't meet size requirements, provide specific resize commands.
